# Code-Conventions-for-the-Java

Why Have Code Conventions
Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:

- 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.

- Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.

- Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.

- If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it is as well packaged and clean as any other product you create.
